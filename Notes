Data Science Specialization
Launch Your Career in Data Science.
A nine-course introduction to data science, developed and taught by leading professors.

About This Specialization
Ask the right questions, manipulate data sets, and create visualizations to communicate results.
This Specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply the skills learned by building a data product using real-world data. At completion, students will have a portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material.

Week 03: Loop Functions and Debugging
  Programming Assignment 2
  
    Write the following functions:
      makeCacheMatrix:
        This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
      cacheSolve:
        This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix
        above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
        the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
    
    In order to complete this assignment, you must do the following:
      Fork the GitHub repository containing the stub R files at
        https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2 to create a copy under your own account.
      Clone your forked GitHub repository to your computer so that you can edit the files locally
        on your own machine.
      Edit the R file contained in the git repository and place your solution in that file (please
        do not rename the file).
      Commit your completed R file into YOUR git repository and push your git branch to the GitHub
        repository under your account.
      Submit to Coursera the URL to your GitHub repository that contains the completed R code for the assignment.
    
    In addition to submitting the URL for your GitHub repository, you will need to submit the 40
      character SHA-1 hash (as string of numbers from 0-9 and letters from a-f) that identifies the
      repository commit that contains the version of the files you want to submit. You can do this
      in GitHub by doing the following
      Going to your GitHub repository web page for this assignment
      Click on the “?? commits” link where ?? is the number of commits you have in the repository.
        For example, if you made a total of 10 commits to this repository, the link should
          say “10 commits”.
      You will see a list of commits that you have made to this repository. The most recent commit
        is at the very top. If this represents the version of the files you want to submit, then
        just click the “copy to clipboard” button on the right hand side that should appear when
        you hover over the SHA-1 hash. Paste this SHA-1 hash into the course web site when you
        submit your assignment. If you don't want to use the most recent commit, then go down and
        find the commit you want and copy the SHA-1 hash.
